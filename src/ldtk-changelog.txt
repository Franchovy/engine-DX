# Version 0.1.3

* Collectibles now use a numerical index to determine their appearance / value.

- Change sprite "Collectible" properties:
--- Remove string property "id"
--- Add non-nullable (default value 0) integer property "index".

# Version 0.1.2

* Dialog sprites can now save dynamic properties which can be used in the code. To set dynamic properties,
* simply write a new line in the dialog text in JSON format, like: {"repeats":true}
* and this will set the variable "repeats" which will be readable in-code.

# Version 0.1.1

* Elevators will now use tracks to determine movement.
* If two tracks intersect where an elevator begins, enter a matching "trackId" and track "uid" to
* pair an elevator with its track.
